<!-- Plugin description -->
Theme highlighting only variables, functions, etc. In other words, just the semantics.

Let's face it, after your first hello world, you already know all of your
language's keywords by heart. Hell, you then know them from most of the other
languages too. Yet your editor is happily highlighting every `if` and `class`
in bright colors like they need your full attention.

What we actually need my friend, is just the semantics. Everything else is
replaced by 'yada yada' by our brain anyway. So this plugin provides a
highlighting scheme that only makes the semantics pop out, with everything else
in neutral colors. Try it! It might save your brain a few percent of attention
juice and lets you focus on debugging the bad code that that amateur 'past
you' wrote.

After installing, enable it in the settings under [Editor] > [Color
Scheme]. Pairs best with the "New UI" system theme.
